This files contains list of custom changes implemented for the SOSIEL-involved simulations.

* MAR-15-2021 Additional log

Currently, BDA's log file includes: 
- year
- initiation cell coordinates
- total event size (number of sites)
- number of damaged sites
- number of cohorts killed total
- mean BDA severity across all sites

Every cohort in the Biomass Succession extension is defined by age and species.
Can you have the log file also output the "total biomass" of the cohorts killed
by species for every infestation event?
Note: This modification will not need to be merged into BDA's GitHub repository.

* MAR-15-2021 Fix log directory creation.

Fixed log directory creation.
